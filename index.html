      <h3>21: Star Wars Episode I Racer</h3>
          <h4>N64/NS/PC</h4><br>
      <p>I don't care what planet you're from - that's gotta hurt! Episode I Racer is just plain fun, far more than the source material it comes from. What other game lets you play as Ben Quadinaros or Gasgano? Now this is podracing!</p>

      <h3>22: Kerbal Space Program</h3>
         <h4>PC</h4><br>
      <p>Kerbal Space Program is a newer entry into my top games list, as the older I get, the more I love the science behind space travel. This is the closest I can get to strapping myself to a rocket and hurtling toward the stars (at least for now), and probably one of the more fun ways to watch myself (and my poor Kerbals) explode on impact.</p>

      <h3>23: Portal/Portal 2</h3>
          <h4>XBOX/PC</h4><br>
      <p>Revolutionary puzzle games in their own right, the Portal series was one I enjoyed from the beginning. Portal 2 doubled down on the original's formula and found unique ways to not only make the game more fun, but more interesting. A triumph, indeed.</p>

      <h3>24: Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005)</h3>
          <h4>PC</h4><br>
      <p>The 2005 Star Wars Battlefront II game was so much better than the newer Battlefront II, and I couldn't tell you how many hours I sunk into it. The Galactic Conquest mode alone was worth the price of admission, but it was just so great to get to play as my favorite characters and to actually have a story woven throughout.</p>

      <h3>25: Super Mario 3</h3>
          <h4>SNES</h4><br>
      <p>Coming in at number 25, Super Mario 3 is a childhood favorite that I couldn't pass up. SMW is more of the crowd favorite, but SMB3 holds a special place in my heart. Fun fact for you if you've gotten this far - I don't know that I've ever beaten SMB3, or any of the older Super Mario games before SM64.</p>
