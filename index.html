      <h3>15: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II/Mysteries of the Sith</h3>
          <h4>PC</h4><br>
      <p>DFII and Mysteries of the Sith were some of the first experiences I had with Star Wars video games, and were so much fun playing around with different force powers and lightsabers and everything. Kyle Katarn is an excellent protagonist (or antagonist if you so choose), and the FMV included in the games makes them even more of a gem and almost Star Wars films of their own in an era before the prequels and sequels!</p>

      <h3>16: The Last of Us</h3>
          <h4>PS3/PS4</h4><br>
      <p>The Last of Us is one of the primary reasons I bought a PS4 - so I could play the remastered edition. This one is a real tearjerker, one that I didn't expect, and the sequel is even more so. TLOU will always be a cinematic masterpiece in game form, and I can't wait for the series.</p>

      <h3>17: I Am Bread</h3>
          <h4>PC</h4><br>
      <p>Join me as we slip into the madness of trying to get a slice of bread out of a trashcan and onto a lawnmower to toast it so its owner also goes mad. We played this on stream a little for birthday celebrations, but this is one of my most hated and loved games all wrapped up into one. Frustrating but rewarding, I Am Bread makes me laugh until I cry and vice versa.</p>

      <h3>18: God of War</h3>
          <h4>PS4</h4><br>
      <p>Confession time - I had never touched a God of War game before the recent PS4 release. With that in mind, and a few Wikipedia articles to explain the story, I dove into this one and didn't stop for two weeks as I tried to beat one of the best games in this past generation. Gorgeous visuals, a stunning soundtrack, and a great story have me excited for the next in the series, and is almost enough reason on its own to invest in a PS5.</p>

      <h3>19: BioShock</h3>
          <h4>X360/PC</h4><br>
      <p>BioShock was the first game I remember with what felt like a movie-level twist in it, the kind that really put me on the edge of my seat and made me pay attention. While BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite were both good in their own right (and Infinite definitely had its wild moments near the end), nothing compares to the real mind games played in the original game.</p>

      <h3>20: LA Noire</h3>
          <h4>X360/PC</h4><br>
      <p>LA Noire was the dark story I didn't know I needed when it came out. Not afraid to throw gut punches, this was the first time I felt like an actual detective in a video game (except for the Batman series, but that's a different kind of detecting). A few refinements to the truth/doubt system and this would be an excellent framework for a modern story of the same caliber.</p>

      <h3>21: Star Wars Episode I Racer</h3>
          <h4>N64/NS/PC</h4><br>
      <p>I don't care what planet you're from - that's gotta hurt! Episode I Racer is just plain fun, far more than the source material it comes from. What other game lets you play as Ben Quadinaros or Gasgano? Now this is podracing!</p>

      <h3>22: Kerbal Space Program</h3>
         <h4>PC</h4><br>
      <p>Kerbal Space Program is a newer entry into my top games list, as the older I get, the more I love the science behind space travel. This is the closest I can get to strapping myself to a rocket and hurtling toward the stars (at least for now), and probably one of the more fun ways to watch myself (and my poor Kerbals) explode on impact.</p>

      <h3>23: Portal/Portal 2</h3>
          <h4>XBOX/PC</h4><br>
      <p>Revolutionary puzzle games in their own right, the Portal series was one I enjoyed from the beginning. Portal 2 doubled down on the original's formula and found unique ways to not only make the game more fun, but more interesting. A triumph, indeed.</p>

      <h3>24: Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005)</h3>
          <h4>PC</h4><br>
      <p>The 2005 Star Wars Battlefront II game was so much better than the newer Battlefront II, and I couldn't tell you how many hours I sunk into it. The Galactic Conquest mode alone was worth the price of admission, but it was just so great to get to play as my favorite characters and to actually have a story woven throughout.</p>

      <h3>25: Super Mario 3</h3>
          <h4>NES</h4><br>
      <p>Coming in at number 25, Super Mario 3 is a childhood favorite that I couldn't pass up. SMW is more of the crowd favorite, but SMB3 holds a special place in my heart. Fun fact for you if you've gotten this far - I don't know that I've ever beaten SMB3, or any of the older Super Mario games before SM64.</p>
